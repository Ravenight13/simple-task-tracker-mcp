## Workspace Detection

**Method:** Auto-detection via `TASK_MCP_WORKSPACE` environment variable
**Expected:** `/Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/simple-task-tracker-mcp`
**Workspace Hash:** `9d3c5ef9`
**Database:** `~/.task-mcp/databases/project_9d3c5ef9.db`

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS - Zero-config workspace detection working

---

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: TaskUpdate Partial Update Validation
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Requires workaround for partial updates

**Description:**
The TaskUpdate Pydantic model runs validators on None values when fields aren't updated. This requires clients to provide current values for `status` and `priority` even when not changing them.

**Workaround:**
```python
# When updating, always include status and priority
update_task(
    task_id=1,
    title="New Title",
    status=current_status,   # Include current value
    priority=current_priority  # Include current value
)
```

**Status:** Documented in session handoff, not blocking production use

**Recommendation:** Consider fixing in v0.2.0 by making TaskUpdate validators handle None values gracefully

## Next Steps: Claude Desktop Integration

### Configuration Steps

1. **Locate Claude Desktop Config:**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add Task MCP Server:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "task-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TASK_MCP_WORKSPACE": "/Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/simple-task-tracker-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

4. **Verification Tests:**
   - [ ] Verify 13 MCP tools available in Claude Desktop
   - [ ] Read existing tasks created in this session
   - [ ] Create new task from Claude Desktop
   - [ ] Verify task appears in both Claude Code and Desktop
   - [ ] Test concurrent access (both clients open simultaneously)

### Expected Behavior

**With WAL mode enabled:**
- Claude Code and Claude Desktop can read tasks concurrently
- Both clients see the same data
- No blocking or locking errors
- Real-time visibility of changes (after refresh)

**Workspace Path:**
- Claude Code: Auto-detected via environment variable
- Claude Desktop: Explicitly set in config (`TASK_MCP_WORKSPACE`)
