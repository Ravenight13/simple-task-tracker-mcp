# Entity System Error Message Consistency Audit

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Auditor:** Claude Code Subagent
**Scope:** All entity system MCP tools in server.py
**Reference:** phase3-completion-plan.md lines 560-567

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** ‚úÖ PASS WITH MINOR RECOMMENDATIONS

All entity tool error messages follow consistent patterns and include required contextual information (entity_id, task_id, identifier, entity_type). The error messages are clear, specific, and aligned with the established standards.

**Statistics:**
- **Total Error Messages Audited:** 11
- **Good Patterns (Compliant):** 11 (100%)
- **Bad Patterns (Non-Compliant):** 0 (0%)
- **Recommendations for Enhancement:** 1 (optional improvement)

---

## Error Message Standards (Reference)

### Good Patterns (from phase3-completion-plan.md)
```python
raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found")
raise ValueError(f"Entity of type '{entity_type}' with identifier '{identifier}' already exists")
raise ValueError(f"Task {task_id} not found or has been deleted")
```

### Bad Patterns (to avoid)
```python
raise ValueError("Entity not found")  # Missing entity_id
raise ValueError("Duplicate identifier")  # Missing details
```

### Criteria Checklist
- [x] All ValueError messages include entity_id/task_id when applicable
- [x] All "not found" errors specify which ID was not found
- [x] All duplicate errors include identifier value and entity_type
- [x] All validation errors reference field name
- [x] All soft-delete errors specify "not found or has been deleted"

## Tool-by-Tool Analysis

### 1. get_entity (lines 897-939)

**Location:** Line 935

**Error Message:**
```python
raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found or has been deleted")
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Includes entity_id: Yes
- Specifies soft-delete state: Yes
- Clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** Follows standard "not found or has been deleted" pattern

---

### 2. create_entity (lines 942-1063)

**Location:** Lines 1027-1030

**Error Message:**
```python
raise ValueError(
    f"Entity already exists: {entity_data.entity_type}='{entity_data.identifier}' "
    f"(id={existing['id']}, name='{existing['name']}')"
)
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Includes entity_type: Yes
- Includes identifier value: Yes
- Provides additional context (existing id, name): Yes
- Clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** Exceeds standard by providing extra context for debugging

---

### 3. link_entity_to_task (lines 1067-1154)

**Locations:** Lines 1116, 1125, 1142

**Error Messages:**
```python
# Task validation (line 1116)
raise ValueError(f"Task {task_id} not found or has been deleted")

# Entity validation (line 1125)
raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found or has been deleted")

# Duplicate link (line 1142)
raise ValueError(
    f"Link already exists between task {task_id} and entity {entity_id}"
)
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- All messages include relevant IDs: Yes
- Soft-delete state specified: Yes
- Duplicate error includes both IDs: Yes
- Clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** All three messages follow standards perfectly

---

### 4. get_task_entities (lines 1158-1248)

**Location:** Line 1223-1225

**Error Message:**
```python
raise ValueError(
    f"Task {task_id} not found or has been deleted"
)
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Includes task_id: Yes
- Specifies soft-delete state: Yes
- Clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** Follows standard pattern

---

### 5. update_entity (lines 1251-1403)

**Locations:** Lines 1341, 1357-1360, 1317

**Error Messages:**
```python
# Entity not found (line 1341)
raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found or has been deleted")

# Identifier conflict (lines 1357-1360)
raise ValueError(
    f"Entity of type '{current_entity['entity_type']}' already exists "
    f"with identifier: {identifier}"
)

# Metadata validation (line 1317)
raise ValueError("metadata must be a JSON string, dict, or list")
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT (with minor note)
- Entity not found includes ID: Yes
- Duplicate error includes entity_type and identifier: Yes
- Metadata validation references field name: Yes
- All messages clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** All messages follow standards

**Note:** The metadata validation error is a type validation, not an entity-specific error, so it appropriately describes the expected types rather than an entity ID.

---

### 6. delete_entity (lines 1406-1491)

**Location:** Line 1462

**Error Message:**
```python
raise ValueError(f"Entity {entity_id} not found or already deleted")
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Includes entity_id: Yes
- Specifies soft-delete state ("already deleted"): Yes
- Clear and specific: Yes

**Pattern Match:** Uses slightly different wording ("already deleted" vs "has been deleted") but semantically identical and equally clear

---

### 7. list_entities (lines 1494-1548)

**Error Messages:** None (no validation errors expected in list operation)

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ N/A
- List operations with filters don't raise errors for empty results
- This is correct behavior

---

## Consistency Analysis

### Positive Findings

1. **ID Inclusion (100% compliant)**
   - All "not found" errors include the specific entity_id or task_id
   - All duplicate errors include relevant identifiers

2. **Soft-Delete Clarity (100% compliant)**
   - All entity/task not found errors specify "or has been deleted" / "or already deleted"
   - Helps users understand the entity exists but is soft-deleted

3. **Duplicate Error Context (100% compliant)**
   - create_entity: Includes entity_type, identifier, existing id, and name
   - update_entity: Includes entity_type and identifier
   - link_entity_to_task: Includes both task_id and entity_id

4. **Validation Error Clarity (100% compliant)**
   - Metadata validation specifies expected types
   - All field-specific validations reference the field name

### Minor Wording Variations

**Observation:** Two slightly different phrasings for soft-delete state:
- Most tools: "not found or has been deleted"
- delete_entity: "not found or already deleted"

**Analysis:** Both are semantically correct and equally clear. "already deleted" emphasizes the idempotent nature of the delete operation.

**Recommendation:** This variation is acceptable and adds semantic precision. No change needed.

---

## Comparison with Task Tools

### Task Tool Error Patterns (for reference)
```python
# From get_task (line 225)
raise ValueError(f"Task {task_id} not found or has been deleted")

# From update_task (line 298)
raise ValueError(f"Task {task_id} not found or has been deleted")

# From delete_task (line 710)
raise ValueError(f"Task {task_id} not found or already deleted")
```

**Consistency Assessment:** ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
- Entity tools follow the exact same patterns as task tools
- System-wide consistency maintained
- "already deleted" pattern used in both delete_task and delete_entity

---

## Recommendations

### No Critical Changes Needed

All error messages meet or exceed the standards. No fixes required.

### Optional Enhancement (Low Priority)

**Consideration:** Standardize "already deleted" vs "has been deleted" across all tools

**Current State:**
- delete_task: "already deleted"
- delete_entity: "already deleted"
- All get/update operations: "has been deleted"

**Analysis:**
- Present perfect ("has been deleted") = State-focused, emphasizes current unavailability
- Simple past ("already deleted") = Action-focused, emphasizes operation was already performed

**Recommendation:** KEEP AS-IS
- The distinction is semantically meaningful
- "already deleted" in delete operations emphasizes idempotency
- "has been deleted" in get/update operations emphasizes current state
- Both forms are grammatically correct and clear

---

## Test Coverage Verification

**Recommendation:** Ensure all error paths have test coverage

### Critical Error Paths to Test:
1. ‚úì get_entity with non-existent ID
2. ‚úì get_entity with soft-deleted entity
3. ‚úì create_entity with duplicate identifier
4. ‚úì update_entity with non-existent ID
5. ‚úì update_entity with conflicting identifier
6. ‚úì update_entity with invalid metadata type
7. ‚úì delete_entity with non-existent ID
8. ‚úì delete_entity with already deleted entity
9. ‚úì link_entity_to_task with non-existent task
10. ‚úì link_entity_to_task with non-existent entity
11. ‚úì link_entity_to_task with duplicate link
12. ‚úì get_task_entities with non-existent task

(Note: Test coverage verification would require examining test files separately)

## Conclusion

### Summary

The entity system error messages demonstrate excellent consistency and adherence to established standards:

- **All messages include relevant IDs** when applicable
- **All messages specify soft-delete state** where relevant
- **All duplicate errors provide complete context** (entity_type, identifier, IDs)
- **All validation errors reference field names** appropriately
- **Phrasing is consistent** across entity and task tools
- **Error messages are clear, specific, and actionable**

### Quality Score: 10/10

No fixes required. The current implementation exceeds the minimum standards and provides excellent user experience through clear, context-rich error messages.
