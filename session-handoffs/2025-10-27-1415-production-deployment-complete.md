---

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Phase 1: Claude Code Production Testing (08:55 - 09:05)

**Comprehensive testing of all 13 MCP tools:**

1. **MCP Tools Registration** ✅
   - All 13 tools discovered and callable
   - mcp__task-mcp__ namespace working

2. **CRUD Operations** ✅
   - create_task: Task ID 1 created
   - get_task: Retrieved successfully
   - update_task: Status transitions working (with workaround)
   - list_tasks: Filtering by status, priority, parent_task_id
   - search_tasks: Full-text search functional
   - delete_task: Soft delete confirmed (task excluded from queries)

3. **Task Hierarchy** ✅
   - Created parent task (ID 2) + 3 subtasks (IDs 3, 4, 5)
   - get_task_tree: Recursive nested structure working
   - Parent/child relationships preserved

4. **Dependencies** ✅
   - Created dependency: Task 7 depends on Task 6
   - Blocking behavior: Cannot complete task 7 until task 6 done
   - Completion flow: Task 6 done → Task 7 completable
   - Auto-set completed_at timestamps

5. **Blocked Tasks** ✅
   - Created blocked task with blocker_reason
   - get_blocked_tasks: Retrieved correctly
   - Validation: Blocked status requires blocker_reason (enforced)

6. **Actionable Tasks** ✅
   - get_next_tasks: Returns todo tasks without dependencies
   - Excluded blocked and completed tasks

7. **Project Management** ✅
   - set_project_name: Set "Task MCP Production Testing"
   - get_project_info: Statistics accurate (7→9→10 tasks)
   - list_projects: Shows 3 projects with friendly names

8. **Validation Constraints** ✅
   - Blocked without blocker_reason: Rejected
   - Invalid status: Rejected
   - State transitions: todo → in_progress → done enforced

9. **Database Structure** ✅
   - Directory: ~/.task-mcp/ created
   - Master DB: master.db (project registry)
   - Project DB: project_9d3c5ef9.db (workspace-specific)
   - WAL mode: Enabled (critical for concurrent access)

**Claude Code Testing:** ✅ 9/9 categories passed
**Test Report:** `docs/subagent-reports/production-testing/2025-10-27-1405-claude-code-production-test.md`

---

### Phase 2: Claude Desktop Configuration (09:05 - 09:10)

**Updated Claude Desktop configuration:**

**File:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["--directory", "/Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/simple-task-tracker-mcp", "run", "task-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TASK_MCP_WORKSPACE": "/Users/cliffclarke/Claude_Code/simple-task-tracker-mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key difference from Claude Code:**
- Claude Code: Auto-detects workspace via environment
- Claude Desktop: Explicit workspace path in config

**Created test prompt:** `docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_TEST_PROMPT.md`

---

### Phase 3: Claude Desktop Integration Testing (09:10 - 09:15)

**Cross-client validation tests:**

1. **MCP Tools Discovery** ✅
   - All 13 tools visible in Desktop

2. **Project Registry** ✅
   - 3 projects listed
   - Friendly name: "Task MCP Production Testing"
   - Workspace path correct

3. **Cross-Client Data Access** ✅
   - **All 9 tasks from Claude Code visible in Desktop** ⭐
   - Task hierarchy intact (parent + 3 subtasks)
   - Status distribution: 6 todo, 2 done, 1 blocked
   - Priority distribution: 4 high, 4 medium, 1 low

4. **Sequential ID Continuity** ✅
   - New Desktop task got **ID 11** (continued from task 10)
   - Proves both clients using same database

5. **Task Creation from Desktop** ✅
   - Created: "Test from Claude Desktop"
   - ID: 11
   - Appeared instantly in shared database

6. **Search Functionality** ✅
   - Search for "Desktop": Found task 11

7. **Concurrent Access** ✅
   - Both clients accessing same DB simultaneously
   - Zero "database locked" errors
   - WAL mode working perfectly
   - No data corruption or conflicts

8. **Task Count Progression** ✅
   - Before Desktop: 9 tasks
   - After Desktop: 10 tasks
   - get_project_info updated correctly

**Claude Desktop Testing:** ✅ 8/8 categories passed
**Test Report:** `docs/subagent-reports/production-testing/2025-10-27-1410-claude-desktop-integration-test.md`

## Key Achievements

### 1. True Cross-Client Access ⭐⭐⭐
**Most Important Achievement:**
- Claude Code and Claude Desktop accessing **the same database**
- Sequential ID continuity (task 11 followed task 10)
- Zero conflicts or data divergence
- WAL mode enabling concurrent reads/writes

### 2. Zero-Config Workspace Detection
**Claude Code:**
- Automatically detects workspace via TASK_MCP_WORKSPACE env var
- No manual configuration needed

**Claude Desktop:**
- Explicit workspace path in config
- Points to same database as Code

### 3. Complete MCP Tool Coverage
All 13 tools operational:
- 6 CRUD tools
- 3 advanced query tools
- 1 maintenance tool
- 3 project management tools

### 4. Production-Grade Database
- SQLite WAL mode: Concurrent access without locking
- Soft delete: 30-day retention
- Foreign keys: Referential integrity
- Auto-timestamps: created_at, updated_at, completed_at

### 5. Comprehensive Validation
- State machine: todo → in_progress → blocked/done → cancelled
- Dependency blocking: Can't complete tasks with incomplete dependencies
- Blocker validation: Blocked status requires blocker_reason
- Description limit: 10k characters (prevents token overflow)

---

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: TaskUpdate Partial Update Validation
**Severity:** Minor
**Impact:** Requires workaround

**Problem:**
TaskUpdate Pydantic model validates None values for priority field.

**Workaround:**
Always include current `status` and `priority` when updating:
```python
update_task(
    task_id=1,
    title="New Title",
    status=current_status,   # Include even if not changing
    priority=current_priority  # Include even if not changing
)
```

**Fix planned:** v0.2.0

### Observation 1: Timestamp Format Inconsistency
**Impact:** None (both formats parse correctly)

Some timestamps use ISO 8601, others use custom format.
**Recommendation:** Standardize to ISO 8601 in future version.

### Observation 2: created_by Always Null
**Impact:** None (field is optional)

Conversation ID tracking requires explicit parameter passing.
**Status:** Working as designed, documented.
